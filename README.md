# css-landing-page
Created a mock call to action webpage using the fundamentals of HTML & CSS.

-Demonstrated extensive use of Flexbox to arrange the content of the page
-Primary difficulty was using Flexbox and relevant tools to make the webpage maintain its proper layout while downsizing the size of the webpage
-The webpage increasingly breaks down in aesthetics especially after it falls below ~1000px width
