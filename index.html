            <h1>Release Soldier Boy</h1>
            <p>Finally being rescued after decades of Communist torture and abuse, the honorable American hero,
                Soldier Boy, has been immediately back-stabbed and sent right back to the cryo chamber. He must be
                reawakened!

                <p>All the way back to WW2 against the Nazis, Soldier Boy has been fighting on the front lines to keep

                <p>Once Soldier Boy was liberated from his Russian captors, he devoted himself to one aim: draining the

                <p>Even after finding out Homelander was his son and Ryan was his grandson, Soldier Boy selflessly
                    pushed onwards to wipe them out only to be betrayed at the critical moment by Butcher and his Boys

                <p>Soldier Boy fought valliantly, but ultimately he was ganged up on, defeated, and cursed back to the
